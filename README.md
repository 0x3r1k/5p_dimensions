  <h1>Dimension System (Routing buckets)</h1>
  <p>
    This is a system to be able to change the dimension to a player, it is made for QBCore and ESX.
    There are two simple commands, one is /setdimension and the other is /getdimension.

    - Example: /setdimension <id> <dimension/bucket> (This will set the chosen player in that dimension, so you avoid in reports to be in front of many users)

    - Example: /getdimension <id> (This will return the player's dimension in a notification)
